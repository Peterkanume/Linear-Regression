# Linear Regession

By the end of this notebook, you should be able to:

Analyze predictor variables and their relationship with the target variable.
Perform feature engineering tasks, including encoding categorical variables and scaling features.
Construct and evaluate multiple linear regression models using appropriate libraries.
Identify and address multicollinearity issues using regularization techniques such as LASSO and Ridge regression.
Interpret regression coefficients and understand their impact on the target variable.
Implement decision tree models for prediction tasks, exploring both categorical and numerical data.
Calculate and interpret MSE and RMSE for model evaluation.
